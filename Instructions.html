        <h1>Hangman Game</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Hangman game! The objective is to guess the hidden word before the hangman is fully drawn</p>

        <div class="instructions">
            <h2>How to Play:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You will be presented with a hidden word in the form of underscores, where each underscore represents a letter.</li>
                <li>Guess the letters that might be in the word.</li>
                <li>If the guessed letter is correct, it will be revealed in its correct position.</li>
                <li>If the guessed letter is incorrect, you lose a try and part of the hangman will be drawn.</li>
                <li>You have a limited number of tries (typically 6) to guess the word correctly before the game is over.</li>
                <li>If you manage to guess the word before running out of tries, you win!</li>
