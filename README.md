### **_Description_**

In our first project for GA, 
I present the popular Hangman game. The goal of the game is to guess
a hidden word by suggesting letters one by one. Each correct guess reveals 
a letter in the word, while incorrect guesses contribute to 
drawing the hanging figure. The game ends when the player succeeds in guessing
the entire word or when the hanging figure is completely drawn. 
The goal is to guess the word before the attempts run out.
